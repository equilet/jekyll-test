DJ Techtools:  Orbit Instrument for Richie Hawtin's ENTER exhibition
---
Plastikman's "Enter." club featured an entire level to house "Orbit".  Orbit is an interactive music table that allows up to 6 performers (12 hands) to perform collaboratively.
Worked with team at DJ Techtools to build an interactive music experience for club in Ibiza, Spain.  In addition to headphones, [Subpacs](https://subpac.com/) were used in order to allow performers to differentiate the low frequencies coming from their input from adjacent rooms in which DJing was happening.
