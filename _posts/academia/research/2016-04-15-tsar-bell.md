# Recasting the Tsar Bell

![tsar bell](/assets/tbell.jpg)

I worked with Chris Chafe, Greg Niemeyer, Edmund Campion, and Perrin Meyer to help realize two pieces in which a reconstructed virtual model of the Tsar Bell used as a performable element.  Since this is/was one of the world's largest bells (although it never rung), it was the interest of a number of researchers to hear it.  [John Granzow](http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/news-research/1568/recasting-the-tsar-bell-with-john-granzow) did a lot of work on the modeling of the bell to 

A quote from Greg Niemeyer on the physical characteristics of bells:

"Although bronze bells don't appear to be elastic, when struck, they deform. The deformation moves throughout the bell, and since the bell is round, the deformation circulates until its energy is absorbed by the environment. The sound comes from the deformation moving the air surrounding the bell. The deformations' constituent frequencies and their amplitudes form waves which define the pitch, volume and timbre of the bell's sound."
