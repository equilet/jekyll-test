# ODOT Immersion Course

This course guided students through an introduction into the odot (o.) programming toolkit for Max/MSP.  ODOT helps the Max programmer in gaining more finite control over the ways in which you are sending data between applications in a network.

Participants constructed sophisticated patches with an emphasis on interaction and exploration, while learning strategies and patterns for managing complexity, debugging, testing, and robustness. The course is tailored to artists and developers working with time-based media.

Background:  odot provides a container, the "odot bundle", an extension of Open Sound Control (OSC), for naming, aggregating, and structuring data. In the Max programming environment, this is supported by a number of externals and patches for creating, manipulating, and displaying these structures. Leveraging this toolkit, students explored the design of complex, real-world patches, with an emphasis on real-time processing.
