I taught the Max/MSP/Jitter workshop with John MacCallum at CNMAT for the years of 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015.
All curriculum for each year was revamped, as we experimented with differing methods of pedagogy.

Topics / content for the morning sessions (and sometimes afternoon slots) included:

- Max Basics 
- Open Sound Control and ODOT
- Events and signals, Data types
- Interactive assignment materials
- Network communications exercises
- Integration of advanced concepts and patches
- Guest lecturers, including Adrian Freed, Andy Schmeder, and David Zicarelli
- David Wessel's lectures
