2014 Modulations Festival

![mod](/assets/modulations.png)

Carr Wilkerson invited me to be a featured artist in 2014's Modulations festival.  It was a great opportunity to catch up with a number of folks I'd gotten to know there over the years, and to spend some time working in their facilities leading up to the show.  Dave Kerr did a great job documenting.  I had a fun time in the collaboration with [Reza Ali](https://www.syedrezaali.com/) who performed visual magic during my set.
