Finite Series #00

Cullen Miller invited me to perform music.  I utilized one of my early modular setups for a solo performance.
David Kanaga of the [Software Label](http://www.softwarelabel.net/) performed the MYST soundtrack live, which was more than a little entertaining.  I also had the chance to meet Madalyn Merkey for the first time, who put on a great performance with MaxMSP.
