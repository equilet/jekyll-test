Finite Series #01

I was invited a second time to perform music at the Finite quarterly.  This time was more involved, and took a bit more time to set up.  I played after hours in the dark.  After Rene Hell and EasySimple (simple) performed, [Gabriel Dunne](http://gabrieldunne.com/) and [Cullen Miller](http://pointlinesurface.com) performed with a live A/V set that they designed with bespoke software.
