Finite Series #02

I was invited a third time to perform music at the Finite quarterly, this time at Gray Area.  This particular performance was more ambient and textural, and I opened for the night.  It was a pleasure to perform alongside [Jan Jelinek](https://faitiche.de/t/artists/janjelinek), a long-time interest of mine.  [Scy1e](https://scy1e.bandcamp.com/) played an excellent spatialized set involving electronics from Peter Blasser's lab, and [Cullen Miller](http://pointlinesurface.com/) collaborated with [David Last](https://www.facebook.com/pg/lastfaithstudio/) in a dance set.
